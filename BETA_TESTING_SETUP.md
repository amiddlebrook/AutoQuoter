# Beta Testing Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the setup process for deploying AutoQuoter to a staging environment and conducting comprehensive beta testing with real users.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git repository access
- Cloud provider account (AWS/GCP for staging deployment)
- Domain name (recommended for realistic testing)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/amiddlebrook/AutoQuoter.git
cd AutoQuoter

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Run the application locally
cd backend
python app.py
```

### Staging Deployment with Docker
```bash
# Build and deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or build custom image for cloud deployment
docker build -t autoquoter-beta:latest .
```

## Beta User Management

### Beta User Database Setup
The application includes a beta user management system in the dashboard. Access it at `/api/dashboard/beta-users` to:
- Add/remove beta users
- Track usage statistics
- Monitor feedback submissions
- Generate invitation links

### User Invitation Process
1. **Generate Invitation Links**: Use the dashboard to create unique beta invitation URLs
2. **Email Templates**: Send personalized invitations with clear instructions
3. **Onboarding Flow**: Guide users through account setup and first quote generation
4. **Support Channels**: Set up dedicated support for beta users

## Monitoring & Analytics Setup

### Application Monitoring
```bash
# Install monitoring dependencies
pip install prometheus-client
pip install elasticsearch

# Configure monitoring in app.py
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - API response times
  - Quote generation speed
  - Error rates by endpoint

- **User Engagement**:
  - Daily/weekly active users
  - Quotes generated per user
  - Feature usage patterns

- **Business Metrics**:
  - Quote-to-lead conversion rate
  - User satisfaction scores
  - Pricing accuracy feedback

## Feedback Collection System

### In-App Feedback Widgets
Add feedback collection points throughout the application:
- After quote generation (rating system)
- On dashboard pages (feature requests)
- Exit surveys (overall experience)

### Feedback Categories
1. **Usability Issues**: UI/UX problems, confusing workflows
2. **Feature Requests**: New functionality suggestions
3. **Bug Reports**: Technical issues, errors, crashes
4. **Pricing Accuracy**: Quote range appropriateness
5. **Performance**: Speed, reliability concerns

### Analytics Integration
```javascript
// Example feedback collection code for frontend
const submitFeedback = async (category, rating, comments) => {
  await fetch('/api/feedback', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      category,
      rating,
      comments,
      userId: currentUser.id,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  });
};
```

## Beta Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (1 week)
- **Participants**: Development team, stakeholders
- **Focus**: Core functionality, critical bugs, performance
- **Goals**: Achieve 99%+ uptime, < 200ms response times

### Phase 2: Small Beta Group (2 weeks)
- **Participants**: 25-50 friendly users (contractors, homeowners)
- **Focus**: Real-world usage, feature validation, user experience
- **Goals**: Collect 100+ feedback items, achieve 85% satisfaction

### Phase 3: Expanded Beta (2-3 weeks)
- **Participants**: 100-200 diverse users across regions
- **Focus**: Scalability testing, market validation, edge cases
- **Goals**: Process 1000+ quotes, validate pricing accuracy

## Support & Communication

### Beta User Support
- **Dedicated Support Email**: beta-support@autoquoter.com
- **Response Time Target**: < 4 hours during business hours
- **Support Documentation**: Comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting guides

### Communication Channels
- **Beta Community Slack/Discord**: For peer-to-peer support
- **Weekly Update Emails**: Progress reports, new features, known issues
- **Feedback Surveys**: Regular satisfaction and feature request surveys

## Success Criteria & Exit Strategy

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 80%+ user satisfaction rate
- [ ] < 1% error rate in production
- [ ] Average response time < 200ms
- [ ] 50% quote-to-lead conversion rate
- [ ] Positive feedback on pricing accuracy (4.5/5 stars)

### Exit Conditions
- **Proceed to Production**: All success criteria met + critical bugs fixed
- **Extended Beta**: 1-2 criteria not met, but trending positive
- **Pivot/Restart**: Major issues discovered requiring significant rework

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Beta Testing Risks
1. **Low User Engagement**: Combat with clear value proposition and easy onboarding
2. **Technical Issues**: Comprehensive pre-launch testing and monitoring
3. **Feedback Overload**: Structured feedback categories and prioritization system
4. **Security Concerns**: Thorough security testing and compliance validation
