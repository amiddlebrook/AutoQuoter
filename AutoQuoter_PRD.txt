Prompt Instruction (for AI Builder)
Given job type {X}, location {Y}, and inputs {materials, sqft, complexity}, generate a fair market quote
range (low, median, high) using wage index {region}, material costs {region}, and contractor historical
data.
This ensures consistent and explainable pricing results across trades and regions.
