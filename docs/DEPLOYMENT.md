# Scalability and Deployment Documentation

## Docker Setup

### Building the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t autoquoter:latest .
```

### Running with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Running Individual Container
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 autoquoter:latest
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud)
- kubectl configured

### Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yml
```

### Scaling the Deployment
```bash
kubectl scale deployment autoquoter-backend --replicas=5
```

### Monitoring
- Use Kubernetes Dashboard for monitoring
- Implement Prometheus and Grafana for metrics
- Set up ELK stack for logging

## Infrastructure Components

### Load Balancing
- Kubernetes Service with LoadBalancer type
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
- Health checks for container readiness

### Database
- PostgreSQL for production data storage
- Redis for caching and session storage
- Data replication for high availability

### Monitoring and Logging
- Application metrics with Prometheus
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Alerting with Grafana

### Security
- Network policies for traffic control
- Secrets management with Kubernetes secrets
- SSL certificates with cert-manager

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Auto-scaling based on resource usage
- Load balancer distributes traffic
- Stateless application design

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource requests and limits
- Node auto-scaling in cloud environments

### Database Scaling
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Development
- Local Docker setup
- Unit tests and integration tests

### Staging
- Automated deployment to staging environment
- End-to-end testing

### Production
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback on failures
- Zero-downtime deployments
